            My Voice is a passion project inspired by my two siblings with
            autism, one of whom is nonverbal. My family and I have seen
            firsthand how crucial communication devices can be in new and
            unfamiliar situations for members of the autism community who have
            trouble expressing themselves. For years, my sister has used a
            picture exchange communication book (pictured) given to her in
            school to communicate. However, this is limited and only has the
            absolute basics. My Voice's Picture to Speech feature provides
            customizable pictures and sayings that is easy to use and edit on
            the go.

            A product like My Voice is something I have looked for for years,
            especially one with a customizable aspect that is also affordable.
            The goal of My Voice is to create an affordable communication device
            that is easy to use and meets you where you are, helping you
            communicate at any level.
