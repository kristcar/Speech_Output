# Welcome to My Voice!

My Voice is a multifaceted communication tool with three main features: Picture to Speak, Type to Speak and Speech to Text. Inspired by my sister who is nonverbal with autism, this tool will act as a voice for you, utilizing the **WebSpeech API** and Google Chrome.  [Check out My Voice here](http://3.143.250.167/) as well as the [full feature demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yEom-lv5zE). 

## Features
* The Picture to Speak page allows users to create custom speech sayings with associated images. When the image is clicked, the browser will read out the associated saying. For example, clicking the water bottle picture will have the browser say "I am thirsty". 
* The Speech to Text page allows the user to speak into their microphone and My Voice will generate and transcribe the text, which can then be copied, using the "Copy Text" button, for later use.
* The Type to Speak page allows users to enter a message into the text box to be read aloud by the browser.
* Validations for login and registration and for creating speech items.
* Demo feature for easy testing and viewing.
* Responsive design utilizing jQuery and Bootstrap.
* Implementation of the WebSpeech API.

*Currently working on: easier microphone access for the deployed site.*
